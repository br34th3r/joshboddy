Welcome to the new site everyone!

I've worked really hard on my React/Gatsby skills in order to put together this new portfolio of basically everything that I'm up to! So stay tuned for more posts and cool features as well as (of course) me and the things I get up to!

All of the code for this site is available on [GitHub]("https://www.github.com/") [here](https://www.github.com/kamohoaliix/joshboddy).

Enjoy looking around to see what's new!
