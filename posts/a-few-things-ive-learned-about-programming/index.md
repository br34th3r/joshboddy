Programming is one of those skills that you can apply almost everywhere. It doesn't discriminate on where and when to use it and can be applied to almost any situation, however, I've started to notice some things about connecting devices and different uses of technologies.

I don't want this blog to target just those who have programming experience, I want it to be open to others that can read and find their own opinions on the content that I post here. Today is not a day like that...

Have any of you ever noticed that most technologies (and I mean the vast majority) don't natively integrate with one another that easily? They require a whole host of different API's and different classes to come together in order to host even some of the most basic functionality. My initial concern became apparent when I was messing around with MongoDB and React JS and trying to get them to interface using stitch apps and atlas cloud hosting. See? Already too many technologies just to store and display information. Why is there no underlying connection between technologies of similar application?

I can understand that by separating technologies we encourage the creativity of allowing users and developers to explore different means of using these mediums and I'm not trying to stick everything together and shut down any other use for them. I just think if there are commonly used technologies in certain areas, then developers should adjust to accommodate for those users and make it easier for them to gather information.

For instance, people always would like a simplistic database to use alongside a web server, it's almost always a given. However, the fact that we cannot seem to do that with installing an immense amount of packages, instead of having some inbuilt interface directly handling structure REST API requests just dumbfounds me.

Ok, weird opinionated rant over,
