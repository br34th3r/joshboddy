I haven't always been an avid sports player. It only started really occurring to me that I was good at certain sports around a few years ago. Before that I avoided them like the plague. I've learned that sport carries some vital life skills that it passes down to those who play and join in, otherwise it's like watching another succeed while you wish away that it could be you.

I have been a part of City University's volleyball team for around half a year now, and looking back I've learned a few important things and skills that I can take into my programming life with me as well.

## Leadership

Even if you don't necessarily take a captain's position in whichever team you play in, it goes to show that every player has to support one another throughout practices and throughout games. I've taken leadership positions several times, only within moments, where I've had to encourage my team, look to teach them and guide them from the knowledge that I have in my own head.

One team cannot rely solely on one or two captains, because no two people together can know the perfect strategy or the perfect encouragement in that moment, and as such it is a requirement that you give your input and help the team thrive with your own energy and co-ordination.

## Group Work

Leading on from leadership, a team is only as good as it's worst player. The team can only survive if all of it's players work in conjunction with one another to produce a desired outcome. This applies not only to the world of sport, but to the world of group work as a whole. One cannot just rely on a captain or captains to carry you through to success, it is a combined effort and something that you should take pride in, as opposed to sitting away in the corner feeling sorry for yourself because you missed a spike or you made a bad play (learn from my own lessons...)

Take the perspective of the whole team as well and show them respect by giving it your all and working with them together as opposed to just sitting on the sidelines and not making any active contribution. It's not worth it...

## Problem Solving

As I said previously, no one person or one group of people knows the one perfect solution to any problem. However, more heads are better than less (weird conversion of the analogy, but ok). It's crucial as a team member you give your input on important problems concerning the team. My main focus has been on the lack of motivation in my team mates when we get on the court, and I like to try and find my own way to bring the energy up.

Problem solving cannot be ignored as an important skill required for any individual to prosper in the work place or even through life generally. You can't go at life without being able to handle problems and issues effectively or else you'll struggle through any task you have to complete.

Don't take this for granted!

That's all from me, just thought I'd rant for a bit about why everyone should take on board some form of competitive sport.

Signing off,
