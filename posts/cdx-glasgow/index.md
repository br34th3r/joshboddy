University life is a... different experience. Lot's of new structures and tasks come up for you to handle and put you into situations where you aren't necessarily your most comfortable. It's interesting...

So far, we've had to tackle 6 different modules.
- Programming in Java
- Operating Systems
- Business Systems (Web Design and Databases)
- Systems Architecture
- Introduction to Algorithms
- Mathematics for Computing

A few of these have been a struggle, whereas others I find that I soar. Taking into account my more recently acquired ability in mathematics I found the final of the modules to be quite interesting and yet still seemed to struggle during exams. Perhaps I can take away that I shouldn't try studying the night before for an exam the next day (especially not after getting off a 2am flight the same day).

At least I can say that the friends I've met keep me sane. I can find support and comfort really easily with them, as well as my girlfriend. It's been almost alike to a rollercoaster of stress and comfort. I switch back and forth between the two quite frequently.

I believe these next few years should bring a lot of interesting scenarios and opportunities for me to explore. As for now, I guess I get to see where this goes...

Signing off,
